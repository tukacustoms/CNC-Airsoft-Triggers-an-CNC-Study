# The main structure

The main base model was made by rever engeniering the Max-Model AEG triggers using the main tecnical drawing that came from buying a sample, using main metrics as angles and metrics. And for the best manufacturing process, was taken for perfomance the structure of the "Speed" Triggers from Canada.

1. Study of "Speed" Triggers from Canada
    The "Speed" Triggers have a different way to return the trigger possition from usual AEG Triggers that use an type of an return spring, on a traditional V2 Triggers the spring is pussing by the side of the trigger using a notch on front of the part and other side of the spring is making pressure on the AEG Gearbox forcing the trigger to return. On the "Speed" Triggers this is different, it uses an helicoidal spring that sits on the back of the trigger that is pushing it away from the gearbox to reset every time.
   Why is this better than traditional AEG side return springs?
     - You can adjust the trigger feel/force just by changing the spring thickness, yes you can make it same way on the traditional return spring but it's easier to source diferent spring thickness to adjust the way you want your trigger to behave, different from side return springs wich are more propietary and unique to source, making it different to tune trigger feel.
     - On helicoidal spring on the back it's a constant force into the trigger since it's middle actuated return spring
     - Easier to assembly on gearbox, one of the main annoying part when adding a trigger is the for of the spring is making the trigger gets out of place when you gonna close the gearbox or when it's difficult to put the trigger in place because the spring is getting out of the correct position, that'd a problem specially with the traditional side return springs on mounting on gearboxes
